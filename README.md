# AI Chatbot for LIC Pension Plans

This project focuses on building an AI-powered chatbot using a custom knowledge base to provide information and assistance regarding LIC pension plans. The chatbot serves as a virtual assistant, offering personalized responses and guidance to users seeking information about various pension plans offered by LIC.

## Overview

During an industrial internship, I developed an AI chatbot utilizing OpenAI API and GPT Index. The chatbot was designed to analyze sales brochure files containing LIC pension plan details and generate relevant responses to user queries. Key components of the project include Google Colab, GitHub, and Jupyter Notebook for development.

## Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
- Trained on a comprehensive dataset encompassing LIC pension plans, eligibility criteria, premium calculations, and related information.
- Addresses common queries, explains plan benefits, offers personalized recommendations, and guides users through the application process.
- Emphasis on accuracy, security, and privacy with robust safeguards to protect user data.
- Continuous monitoring and improvement mechanisms for enhanced performance.

## Training Large Files with Generative AI

When training a large file with customized data using generative AI, chunking is essential to facilitate the training process. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Prepare the Training Data:**
   - Gather customized data in suitable text format.
   - Preprocess data to clean and organize it appropriately.

2. **Chunking the Data:**
   - Analyze the size and complexity of the data file.
   - Determine an appropriate chunk size based on computing resources.
   - Divide the data file into smaller coherent subsets.

3. **Aggregating the Results:**
   - Process and train each chunk.
   - Aggregate results to form a complete generative AI model.


By chunking the data, the training process becomes more efficient, avoiding memory limitations and enabling scalable processing.

## Conclusion

The AI chatbot developed for LIC pension plans simplifies the process of obtaining information, offering personalized assistance, and empowering users to plan for retirement effectively.
